# telescrape

A tool to scrape Telegram users from supergroups.

Requires **telethon** ([https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)) for interfacing with Telegram APIs and **slugify**. This tool allows you to scrape username, userid, groupid, and more from supergroups to CSV for further analysis and use.

Requires Telegram API as user (not @botfather) - you can generate your keys here:  [https://my.telegram.org/auth](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
