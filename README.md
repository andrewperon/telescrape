# telescrape
A tool to scrape Telegram users from supergroups.

Requires telethon (https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) for interfacing with Telegram APIs. This tool allows you to scrape username, userid, groupid, and more from supergroups to CSV for further analysis and use.

Requires Telegram API as user (not @botfather) - you can generate your keys here: https://my.telegram.org/auth
